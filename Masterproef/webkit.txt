Pro Android Web Apps: Develop for Android Using HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript

The Android OS implements a WebKit-based browser. WebKit (http://webkit.org) is an 
open source browser engine that has reached a notable level of adoption for desktop 
and mobile browsers alike. The WebKit engine powers many popular browsers like 
Chrome and Safari on the desktop, and mobile Safari and the native Android browser in 
mobile (to name a few). This alone is a great reason to build web applications for mobile 
rather than native applications. As both Android and the iPhone implement a native 
WebKit browser (Mobile Safari is WebKit at its core), you can target both devices very 
simply if you consider WebKit as your common denominator. 
Why is having WebKit in common so important? Given HTML5 and CSS3 are both still 
emerging specifications, it will probably be a couple of years before web standards are 
concrete and mobile browsers all behave in a consistent way. For now, having WebKit 
as a common element between the two dominant consumer smartphone platforms is a 
huge advantage. As developers, we can build applications that make use of the 
components of HTML5 that are starting to stabilize (and are thus being implemented in 
more progressive browser engines, such as WebKit), and actually have a good chance 
of making those applications work on both an Android handset and an iPhone. Try doing 
that with either native Android Java code or iPhone Objective-C code. 
NOTE: Adoption of WebKit as the “mobile browser of choice” appears to be gaining momentum. 
Research In Motion (RIM), the company responsible for BlackBerry, has adopted WebKit and 
HTML5 in its new BlackBerry Torch. This is good news for mobile web application developers, 
and I believe shows the future is in cross-platform web development rather than the current 
trend of native development.
