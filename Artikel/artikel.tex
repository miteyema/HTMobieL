\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The need to make mobile applications that run on every device is ever-growing.
One solution is to build mobile web applications using HTML5.
To speed up development, different frameworks exist that help in functionality and building a user interface.
Because of the variety of existing frameworks, a thoroughly comparison is needed to know which framework suits the job best.
This paper compares \st{}, \jqm{}, \kendo{} and \lungo{} by using popularity, productivity, usage, support and performance as comparison criteria.

\section{Introduction} % (1 blz)
\label{sec:introduction}
%TODO: inleiding langer maken
The mobile landscape is very heterogeneous and making mobile applications can therefore be a challenging task.

\section{Background}
%TODO: of alles samennemen?
This paper focusses on smartphones and tablets as mobile devices. 
Other mobile devices like PDA's and e-readers are left out of scope.

\subsection{Mobile devices}
Since the release of the Apple iPhone in 2007~\cite{David2011}, the demand for smartphones is ever since increasing. 
Today, over one billion smartphones are in use globally~\cite{Yang2012}.
This will double by 2015~\cite{Gillett2012}.
Also tablets conquer market share as mobile devices.
760 million tablets will be in use globally by 2016~\cite{Gillett2012}.
Besides Apple, other companies like Google and Microsoft are on the track too.

All those mobile devices come in different shapes and sizes.
They also include different features like GPS, camera and connectivity like Bluetooth, WiFi and 3G.

%TODO Tim: deze sectietitel laten vallen, want ik praat ook over browsers
\subsection{Mobile operating systems}
In this section two mobile operating systems (OS) with the greatest market share are discussed: iOS and Android with 14.9\% and 75.0\% respectively in Q3 of 2012~\cite{Protalinski2012}.
These mobile OSs run both on smartphones and tablets.

The mobile OS from Apple, called iOS, first appeared in 2007.
Since then, a new version was released every year with the most recent version being iOS~6.1 which was released in January~2013~\cite{Deitel2012,PhilDutson2012,Apple2013}.
The mobile browser from Apple shipped with iOS is called Mobile Safari.
Apple did make sure to catch up with the latest HTML5 specifications in its browser~\cite{Hales2012}.
This was also because of the dropped support for Adobe Flash on their mobile devices~\cite{Jobs2010}.

In 2005, Google bought Android Inc. and released its first stable mobile OS, called Android, in 2008~\cite{Satyesh2012}.
Like with iOS, new versions were released on a yearly basis.
Android~4.2 is the latest version and was released in October 2012~\cite{Sawers2012}.
Android comes with the Android browser.
The implementation of HTML5 specifications has dragged, but as of Android 4.0, support is increasing~\cite{Hales2012}.
It is now also possible to install the mobile version of the Chrome desktop browser on devices with Android 4.0 and later.

It is important to look at the usage of the different OS versions, which is shown in table~\ref{table:mos-versions}.
This is because not every user has (updated to) the latest version on his mobile device.
The table shows that almost 90\% of iOS users already has version iOS~6.x.
In contrast, about a half of the Android users is still using Android~2.x while the latest major version is Android~4.x. 
Those users cannot benefit of the latest bells and whistles, particularly the new features of HMTL5, on their devices.

\label{table:mos-versions}
\end{table}

\subsection{Mobile applications}
There are three possible ways to make a mobile application~\cite{Accenture2012,Hales2012}.
The first one is a \emph{web application} which runs entirely in the browser.
The second type of application is a \emph{native application} which is installed on the device and programmed in a language specific to the mobile OS.
Lastly, a mix of both can be made which is called a \emph{hybrid application}.
One approach is to pack the web application as a native application.
The other approach is to use one programming language to build native applications for different OSs.

Advantages of web applications are the presence of a browser on mobile devices, so everyone can use it directly without installing the app first and regardless of their mobile OS~\cite{Accenture2012}.
Secondly, the code needs only to be written once and can be run anywhere (WORA)~\cite{Hales2012}.
This is in contrast to native, were a codebase has to be maintained for every mobile OS.
Lastly, web applications do not need to be published to a store (e.g. App Store for iOS and Google Play for Android) prior to release.
Such a store is a place where users can download application to their mobile device.
A disadvantage of web applications is that they are dependent on the mobile OS just like native applications.
This is especially the case when using new features of HTML5 in web applications.

In contrast, native applications provide better performance~\cite{Accenture2012}.
Secondly, it is easier to use features like GPS and camera of the mobile device with a native application.
Thirdly is a security issue were web applications lack behind.
Lastly, publishing applications through a store has two advantages.
On the one hand it increases publicity.
On the other hand stores can also control the quality of the applications, which is not the case for web applications.

The advantage of hybrid applications is that they patch the issues of web applications with the benefits of native applications.
However, as of December 2012, HTML5 went into candidate recommendation~\cite{Jacobs2012}.
This implies the upcoming support of HTML5 in contemporary browsers and that hybrid applications will probably become obsolete over time.

%\subsection{Mobile browsers}
%As of 2008, we speak of the mobile web~\cite{Hales2012}.
%We access the Internet more and more from our browser on our mobile device.
%These browsers are becoming platforms on their own as they give access to the features of the device like GPS and camera. 
%We explore three mobile browsers with the largest market share, as can be seen in table~\ref{table:mobile-browsers}.
%
%\begin{table}
%\centering
%\begin{tabular}[b]{l r@{.}l}
%\toprule
%\textbf{Mobile browser} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Share (\%)}} \\
%\midrule
%Mobile Safari		& 61 	& 02	 	\\
%Android browser		& 18 	& 30 	\\
%Opera Mini			& 9 		& 84 	\\

%Other				& 8		& 82		\\
%\bottomrule
%\end{tabular}
%\caption{Market share of mobile  browsers on January 2013~\protect\cite{NetApplications2012}.}
%\label{table:mobile-browsers}
%\end{table}
%
%The second runner-up is Opera Mini.
%It is a mobile browser where the browser engine is located on the servers of Opera.
%This means that the requested web page is not processed on the device itself.
%In contrast, Opera Mobile includes the browser engine.

%\subsection{HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript}
%The tree building blocks of (mobile) HTML5 (application) development are HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
%The first is responsible for content, the second for presentation and the third for functionality. 
%
%HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language) has came a long way since 2004 and is still not finished~\cite{MacDonald2011}.
%We can see HTML5 as eight classes \cite{W3C2012}: (1) semantics, (2) offline and storage, (3) device access, (4) connectivity, (5) multimedia, (6) 3D, graphics and effects, (7) performance and integration and (8) CSS3.
%Not all classes like CSS3 and geolocation are part of the HTML5 specification, but they are seen as HTML5 features~\cite{MacDonald2011}.
%Not all specifications of HTML5 are implemented in each browser, which makes it very challenging.
%
%CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets) is the hart of web design.
%Some of the important characteristics~\cite{MacDonald2011} are media queries which can be used to adapt the layout to the device, called responsive design.
%Secondly, it is possible the achieve transitions without the use of JavaScript.
%Lastly custom fonts can be included and used throughout the web page.
%
%JavaScript started in 1995 and is now mostly used to do DOM (Document Object Model) traversal and adaption~\cite{PhilDutson2012}.
%The DOM is an API (Application Programming Interface) for HTML documents~\cite{Hegaret2004}.
%Because of the differences in implementation, JavaScript libraries like jQuery are used to ease implementation.

\section{Related Work} % Sander 0.25 pg
\label{sec:related-work}

%TODO related work buiten HTML5, native? anders literatuur buiten vergelijkingscriteria?

Many in-depth comparisons of mobile HTML5 frameworks already exist today.  
However, none of them are scientifically published or use a large proof of concept (POC) to validate their comparison.  
The idea of using a small-scale POC is not new.  
\cite{Oeflman2011} and~\cite{Kosmaczewski2012},  for example,  use a small geosocial game and todo list application respectively to compare mobile HTML5 frameworks.
Blog posts like~\cite{Sarrafi2012a,Ayuso2012,Rozynski2011} all have their own criteria and methodologies to assess different mobile frameworks.  
The overall application of the criteria changes from use case to use case.  
\cite{Rozynski2011} presents the chosen criteria and discusses them for each framework.  
\cite{Ayuso2012} presents 17 criteria but all of them are discussed at once per framework.  
Thereafter,  advantages and disadvantages are subtracted and proposed to the reader.  
Finally, \cite{Sarrafi2012a} presents their chosen criteria together with a scorecard and an explanation of scores per criterion.  
Each framework gets evaluated based on the scores for each criterion.

All these blog posts compare mobile and hybrid frameworks.  
Other websites like~\cite{Bristowe2012,Burris} only focus on two mobile HTML5 frameworks in contrast to ~\cite{Falk2011} who tries to compare as much as frameworks as possible in a large tabular form.

\section{Comparison criteria} %Sander 0.75 pg
\label{sec:comparisoncriteria}
%TODO nieuwe criteria ipv oude, wel kort zeggen welke dat we eerst initieel gingen doen

%TODO waarom criteria niet gekozen

The comparison study will be driven by a Proof of concept (POC).  
This POC encompasses an application to let employees attach, sign and submit expenses to their employer via tablet or smartphone.
Afterwards, the employee can view the uploaded expenses and download them as PDF.

Five important criteria will be used:  popularity,  productivity,  usage,  support and performance. 
The POC can be used in all but the first.   
A methodology that results in a score for each criterion will be described below.  
Per criterion,  a table or graph will be provided so give an overview of the total scores
At the final stage,  these scores will be plotted in a spider graph~\cite{Few2005}.   

\paragraph{Popularity}
%TODO Tim: oude tekst
%The activity around frameworks in social media has to be considered with a lot of care.  
%If,  for example,  a framework has a lot of questions on Stack Overflow,  one could conclude the framework has a lot of ambiguity.  
%Someone else could argue  the framework has a large active Internet community build around it.  
%Also,  the numbers of Twitter followers and Facebook likes only give an indication of the popularity of the framework,  there is no exact science involved.

Social networks provide a good indication to determine the popularity that goes with the framework.  
%\cite{Sarrafi2012a,Ayuso2012} use 
Twitter followers ($T$),  GitHub stars ($S$),  GitHub forkers ($F$),  Stack Overflow questions ($S$) and Facebook likes ($FB$) will be looked at.
The summation of these five numbers give the score for the framework's popularity.  

\begin{equation}
  T+S+F+SO+FB
  \label{eq:populariteit}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Productivity}
Both autors implement the full POC in a different framework and carefully record the time to implement it.  
As both start with a similar background,  time differences can explain different learning curves.  
To double check this criterion,  a partially implemention of the POC will be implemented in the other's framework.  
The partial implementation is the POC's login that loads a long list.%, just like~\cite{Burris}.   
The time to implement the POC ($t_{POC}$) and the login application ($t_{login}$) give the score for the framework's productivity. 

\begin{equation}
  {t_{POC} + t_{login}}
  \label{eq:productiviteit}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Usage}
The POC will be subdivided in $13$ challenges and $38$ subchallenges.  
The score of this criterion will depend on the completion of the challenges by the framework.  
The assessment of the challenges can be found in table~\ref{table:challenges-scores}.  
The total of all challenges give the score for the framework's usage.

\begin{table}[h]	
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Score} & \textbf{Assessment criteria}\\
\midrule
$C_{i} = 2$ & Supported by the framework\\
$C_{i} = 1$ & A plugin or HTML5 feature is needed\\
%TODO: beter woord vinden
$C_{i} = 0$ & No, custom or hacky implementation\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Assessment criteria for implementation challenges.}
\label{table:challenges-scores}
\end{table}

\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=1}^{38}{\left(C_{i}\right)}
  \label{eq:gebruik}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Support}
This criterion indicates the correct functionality of the POC implementation on different contexts.
A context is a combination of a particular operatingsystem, device and browser.
Both Android and iOS, smartphones and tablets will be checked.
Only native browsers will be looked at.
In total eight contexts will be checked for support.
%,  similar as the cross-platform capabilities of~\cite{Sarrafi2012a}.  
In each context,  a subset of the challenges from the previous criterion will be checked.  
These are the challenge were the framework actually provided an implementation ($U_{i} > 0$).
If the challenge works as expected $C_{c,i} = 1$.
If some part of challenge is infeasible $C_{c,i} = 0$.
The summation of scores for each context will give the score for the framework's support.

\begin{equation}
  \sum_{c=1}^{8}{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N}C_{c,i}\right)}
  \label{eq:ondersteuning}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Performance}
The loading time of an HTML5-application is a major bottleneck for performance.
Therefor,  the loading time of the POC ($l_{c,POC}$) and login application ($l_{c,login}$) will be measured on eight devices.
Also,  the loading time for a cached version of both the POC ($l_{c,POC_{cache}}$) and login application ($l_{c,login_{cache}}$) will be recorded.
The summation of loading times will give the score for the framework's performance.

\begin{equation}
  \sum_{c=1}^{8}{\left(l_{c,POC}+l_{c,POC_{cache}}+l_{c,login}+l_{c,login_{cache}}\right)} 
  \label{eq:performantie}
\end{equation}

\section{Frameworks} % (0.5 blz per framework + tabel)
\label{sec:frameworks}
%TODO: tekst voor alle 4 de frameworks
This section introduces the explored mobile HTML5 frameworks: jQuery Mobile (jQM) and \st{} (\sta{}).

\subsection{\st} % (0.5 blz Sander)
\label{sec:frameworks-sencha-touch}

\sta{} is a framework developed by Sencha,  a company founded in 2010 as a composition of Ext JS, jQuery Touch and Raphaël.  
Ext JS is a JavaScript framework for the development of HTML5 applications.  
jQuery Touch is a jQuery plugin for mobile development that adds touch events to jQuery and depends on the WebKit engine.  
Finally,  Raphaël, is a JavaScript library for vector drawings.  
Parts of the first two technologies can be found in the implementation of the \sta{} framework.    

As at the time of writing,  \sta{} is at version 2.2.0~\cite{Inc.}.

\paragraph{Documentation}
All documentation for \sta{} can be found at \exturl{docs.sencha.com/touch/2-0}.  
The most important features are provided with code examples and live previews.
The key concepts of \sta{} are explained in extensive tutorials:  some are texts, some are videos.  

Another handy tool to discover the \sta{} features is the Kitchen Sink~\cite{Inc.2013}.  
This is a HTML5-application that lines up all possibilities of the framework combined with the corresponding code.

\paragraph{Licence}
\sta{} is free within a commercial context in which the developer does not share the code with its users.  
There is also the option to use an open-source version.  
This comes with a GNU GPLv3 license which implies a free code redistribution as most important property.
Other licenses can be found at~\cite{SenchaInc.}.
  
\paragraph{Code and development}
\sta{} is written on top of Ext JS,  and can also be considered as a JavaScript framework.  
All code needs to be written in JavaScript and loaded by one HTML-container.  
Another important aspect of \sta{} is that it supports the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.  
Models group fields to data objects,  views define how the content is presented to the user and controllers connect these based on events.

\sta{} contains all UI-elements as JavaScript objects.  
Just like object-oriented programming,  those objects are part of a class system.  
Classes can be defined and/or created.  
Single inheritance and overriding is also possible.    

To enhance performance,  it is the programmer's task to create components before they are used.  
In this way,  the programmer partially determines the performance of the application.

\paragraph{Browser support}
Just like jQuery Touch,  \sta{} is based upon the WebKit browser engine.  
This forms the major requirement for browser support.  
Although most mobile browsers contain this engine,  some like FireFox Mobile and Opera Mobile lack behind~\cite{JohnEClark2012}.  
The next release of the Opera browser will contain the WebKit engine~\cite{Wokke2013}, a trend that most browser vendors will (have to) follow.

The framework offers the programmer methods to ask for the current context where the end-user is working in.
This functionality is comparable with Modernizer~\cite{Modernizr2012}.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{\kendo} % (0.5 blz Sander)
\label{sec:frameworks-kendo}

\kendo{} is a framefrom from Telerik and consists of three layers:  \kendo{} Web,  \kendo{} Mobile and \kendo{} DataViz.
The first focusses on the development of webapplications,  the second makes them mobile and the last facilitates data representation.
\kendo{} is an hybrid form between JavaScript and markupdriven.
It is build upon the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture and requires the jQuery library.

As at the time of writing,  \kendo{} is at version 2013 Q1~\cite{Telerik}. 

\paragraph{Documentation}
The documentation can be found at \url{http://docs.kendoui.com}~\cite{Telerikd}.
Two important sections are the API and Getting Started.
Both sections follow the same structure and each feature from the API is explained in detail in the Getting Started section.
Also,  every feature can be viewed in a demo with the corresponding code.

\paragraph{Licence}
A licence for \kendo{} Complete costs $\$699$ per developper.
Each layer can be bought separately for a different license fee.
\kendo{} also provides server-side wrappers that can automatically create client-side JavaScript code.
As at the time of writing, PHP,  JSP and ASP.NET MVC are supported as server-side technologies.
A license for a server-side wrapper costs $\$300$~\cite{Telerik}.

\paragraph{Code and development}
Both JavaScript and HTML-code needs to be writter because \kendo{} is both JavaScript and markupdriven.

\kendo{} is dependent on the jQuery library.
Just like \jqm{} there are tree strategies for building webapplications:  single-page application,  view per page or a combination of both.

The MVVM architecture is imposed by \kendo{}.
The views and models are similar with the views and models of the MVC architecture from \st{}.
The view-model is an object that binds views with models in both directions and is called \code{ObservableObject} in \kendo{}.
The binding is annotated in HTML with data tags.
\kendo{} supports bindings based on different properties from JavaScript objects.
Examples of the properties are \code{checked,  value} or \code{visible}.
If a view is bound to a model,  the model is changed when a user changes the content of a view or the view is changed when the model is programmatically updated.

\paragraph{Browser support}
One of the most important aspects of \kendo{} is the mimicking of the native look-and-feel of the current operatingsystem.
Supported platforms are iOS,  Android,  BlackBerry and Windows Phone~8.

All widgets are from \kendo{} Web support progressive enhancement.
Also,  the features of \kendo{} Mobile that depend on HTML5 support progressive enhancement.
The styling of forms,  for example,  will still work on older platforms, but the functionality will be limited to text input only.

\subsection{jQuery Mobile} % (0.5 blz Tim)
\label{sec:jqm}

jQM is a mobile HTML5 user interface~(UI) framework that was announced in 2010~\cite{Resig2010}. 
In November 2011 version~1.0 was released~\cite{Parker2011} and one year later in October, version~1.2 was released~\cite{Parker2012}. 
As at the time of writing, jQM released version~1.3 \cite{Parker2013a}.
The framework is controlled by the jQuery Project that also manages jQuery Core. 
The latter is a JavaScript library where jQM is dependent on~\cite{JQuery2012}. 
jQM is among other things sponsored by Adobe, Nokia, BlackBerry and Mozilla~\cite{JQuery2012a}.

\paragraph{Licence}
As of September 2012 it is only possible to use jQM under the Massachusetts Institute of Technology~(MIT) licence~\cite{Dmethvin2012}. 
This means that the code is released as open source and can also be used in proprietary projects~\cite{PhilDutson2012}.

\paragraph{Documentation}
One can find the documentation of jQM on \exturl{www.jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0}. On the one hand it contains an overview of all possible UI components. 
By checking the source code, you can find out what code to write to get the same result. 
On the other hand it explains the API on how to configure defaults, use events, methods, utilities, data attributes and theme the framework \cite{JQuery2012b}.

\paragraph{Code and development}
jQM is a mark-up driven UI framework and thus provides mainly UI components. 
jQM provides 6 categories of components: pages and dialogs, toolbars, buttons, content formatting, form elements and litsviews~\cite{JQuery2012b}. 
One can obtain these components by writing HTML5 with jQM specific \code{data-}* attributes. 
When running the application, jQM will add the extra necessary code to correctly show these components by doing progressive enhancement.

There are three ways of writing a HTML5 application in jQM~\cite{Broulik2012}. 
The first one is to write the full application on one single web page.
The advantage is that there are initially less requests to the server.
The second option is to write a web page for each screen. 
The advantage here is that the first viewed screen is downloaded more quickly. 
However, with each transition, the next screen has to be fetched which can delay navigation.
This is done with AJAX by default in jQM.
Lastly, you can mix the two above to find an optimum by putting the most likely viewed screens on one web page and the less likely viewed on separated pages.  

\paragraph{Browser support}
\label{sec:jqm-browser-support}
jQM divides browsers into three grades: A, B and C. 
An A graded browsers supports everything of the jQM framework, where a C graded browsers only provides basic HTML experience (so for example no CSS3 transitions)~\cite{JQuery2012d}.

\subsection{\lungo} % (0.5 blz Tim)
\label{sec:frameworks-lungo}

\lungo{} is a mark-up drive framework of which version~1.0 appeared in 2011~\cite{TapQuo2011}.
The framework is maintained by the Spanish company TapQuo that is specialised in mobile user experience~\cite{TapQuo2013a}.
\lungo{} depends on  \quo{} which is a \js{} library optimised for mobile.
%\lungo{} biedt vooral GI-elementen aan, maar daarnaast zijn er ook \term{wrappers} voor cache, opslag en SQL beschikbaar~\cite{TapQuo2013}.
%Er wordt geen programmeerstijl zoals MVC afgedwongen.
As of the time of writing, \lungo{} is at version~2.1~\cite{TapQuo2013}.

\paragraph{Documentation}
Documentation can be found on \exturl{lungo.tapquo.com/howto/prototype} where on the first page the boilerplate code for a typical \lungo{} application is shown.
There are eight other pages explaining briefly the various UI components and API functionality.
On these page the source code is shown for each example.
One can also view a live preview of each example.
The documentation of the underlying \js{} library can be found on \exturl{quojs.tapquo.com}.
It exists of only one page with a very brief summary of the API.

\paragraph{Licence}
The framework is released by the GPLv3 licence.
A commercial licence is also available, but because of the lack of information, the authors contacted TapQuo via email to obtain more info.
However as of writing, they did not receive any answer.

\paragraph{Code and development}
Programming a \lungo{} application is done by annotating the HTML code with CSS classes and \code{data-*} attributes.
There is no architecture like MVC enforced by the framework.
To manipulate the DOM, the developer has to use \quo{}.
This \js{} library that is optimised for mobile does not contain methods for desktop users therefore making it smaller than traditional \js{} libraries like jQuery.
The library does not enforce an architecture.

One can write a single page web application or create multiple pages for each screen.
The \code{<article>} and \code{<section>} HTML5 tags are used to separate the different screens of the application.
\lungo{} supports a multipage web application by providing an asynchronous loader when initializing the application.
Only the code between the \code{<body>} tags of the screens need to be saved on different web pages.

\paragraph{Browser support}
The framework indicates on their website to have support for iOS, Android, Blackberry and FirefoxOS.
They also want to have a consistent experience across mobiles, tvs and desktops~\cite{TapQuo2013}.

\section{Evaluation}
This section evaluates the mobile HTML5 frameworks by five criteria, namely popularity~(\ref{sec:evaluation-popularity}), productivity~(\ref{sec:evaluation-productivity}), usage~(\ref{sec:evaluation-usage}), support~(\ref{sec:evaluation-support}) and performance~(\ref{sec:evaluation-performance}).

%TODO enkel nieuwe evaluatie, niet de oude

\subsection{Popularity} % (0,5 blz)
\label{sec:evaluation-popularity}

%TODO Tim: oude tekst
%An explanation could be explained by the large success of jQuery,  a popular JavaScript library~\cite{Hales2012}.
%The fact that ST had the first stable 1.0 release in mobile UI frameworks~\cite{Oeflman2011},  is not reflected in the community numbers.  
%\cite{Inc.} states that Sencha is the largest provider of open source HTML5 application frameworks with more than two million developers.  
%ST itself embraces about one quarter of this number.
%ST is not available on GitHub,  that is why no data is given.

The scores for popularity can be found in table~\ref{tabel:evaluatie-popularity}. 
\kendo{} takes the first place due to the large amount of \fb{} likes.
\jqm{} and \st{} take respectively second and third place despite the fact that these two framework are the most popular in literature~\cite{David2011,Firtman2013,Hales2012,Oeflman2011}. 
The last place goes to \lungo{} with a remarkable low popularity on \so{} and \fb.
When looking at the total, there are two groups of frameworks.
On the one hand there is \kendo{} together with \jqm{} and the other hand there is \st{} together with \lungo{}.

\jqm{} has the most followers on Twitter, followed by \kendo.
\lungo{} is the penultimate, but the ratio tweets to followers indicate that it is the most active one. 
\jqm{} and \kendo{} have a similar ratio.
This is in contrast to \st{} which has send only one tweet and also has the least number of followers. 

Only \jqm{} and \lungo{} are on \gh{}. 
If the \gh{} stars and \gh{} forkers are left out of popularity, the ranking stays the same.

\kendo{} references in the support menu on their website directly to \so{}. 
However the popularity of \kendo{} is lower than \jqm{}.
\st{} is the penultimate, but more surpassingly is that \lungo{} only has about 30 questions on \so{} and therefore takes the last place.

\kendo{} and \jqm{} both have created a fan page on \fb{} in respectively November, 2011 and August, 2010.
The fan page of \kendo{} thus has gained more \fb{} likes in a shorter period than the earlier created fan page of \jqm{}.
An explanation is that the different layers of \kendo{} are aggregated on one fan page.
This is in contrast to \jqm{} where a separate fan page exists for jQuery that has about 53,000 likes.
This number is similar to that of \kendo{}.
\st{} and \lungo{} only have a \term{interessepagina} on \fb.
This explains the great difference in \fb{} likes.
If the likes are left out of popularity, \kendo{} and \jqm{} switch places.

\subsection{Productivity} % Sander 0,5 blz
\label{sec:evaluation-productivity}

% nieuwe cijfers vermelden en nieuwe data

This section will investigate the productivity of the different frameworks based on the time to implement the POC and the login application.
Table~\ref{tabel:evaluatie-productiviteit} contains the scores for this criterion.
The data shows that \lungo{} is the obvious winner,  followed by \kendo{} en \jqm{}.
\st{} appears to be the least productive.

Two important factor need to be taken into account when analyzing this data.
First,  the implementations of the POC and login application were first executed with \jqm{} and \st{}.
The gained experience helped the developpers in the second implementation phase.
Also,  problems with the backend were resolved in the first implementation phase.

The imposed architecture with \st{} and \kendo{} increases the learning curve.
Also, the fact that a framework is JavaScript driven complicates the implementation.
This is why \st{} is the least productive.

There are also other factor that influence the productivity.
Firstly,  tools can speed up the production process.
Sencha provides Sencha Architect,  a graphical environment to visualy build applications from the ground up.
Version 2.1 of Sencha Architect was used to build the views but was not of much use to build more sophisticated functionality.
Secondly,  boilarplate code can be used to initialize a new project.
All frameworks beside \lungo{} describe such code in their documentation.
\st{} even offers Sencha Cmd to automate this process.
Also, the quality and quantity of the documentation influence the productivity.
A well-engineered search functionality,  real-time code examples and structure classification is crucial for a good documentation.
\kendo{} is the only framework that which documentation has all three components.  
An other factor is the available literature.
Safari Books Online contains $12$ books that specifically discuss \jqm{},  \lungo{} has no books at all.
The final factor is the different places where a developper can go to ask questions.
Stack Overflow or fora are examples of such places. %TODO fora?
As presented in the previous criterion,  \jqm{} expells in the amount of Stack Overflow questions

%  \item C2.3 Enabling smartphone menu.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\framework{\sta}{}
%Detection of a smartphone context is done via the \code{Ext.os.is.Phone} method.  
%If this method returns false,  we assume to be in tablet mode.    
%The main screen of the POC requires a splitted view in tablet mode.  
%A \code{vbox} layout splits the viewport with a vertical axis.  
%The \code{flex} property defines the ratio of the sizes of both resulting components. 
%In smartphone mode,  the left screen is made invisible and an extra menubutton in the header is created.  
%Making the sub header clickable is not possible  
%
%\framework{\kendoa}{}
%\kendo{} also provides methods to query the context.
%\code{kendo.support.tablet},  for example,  returns if a tablet is being used.
%The splitview for the tablet layout is supported by \kendo{} and can be used by defining your view as \code{splitview} as value of the data attribute \code{data-role}.
%The smartphone layout needs to be build by manipulating the DOM with jQuery methods.
%
%\framework{\jqma}{}
%No functionality is provided by the framework, so a search for plugins was started~\cite{Deering2012}.
%However it was shown that the use of CSS3 media queries can accomplish the same without a plugin~\cite{Hadlock2012}.
%The documentation of \jqma{}~1.2 also used a similar approach~~\cite{JQuery2012b}.
%This approach is also encouraged in the documentation of \jqma{}~1.3~\cite{JQuery2013e}.
%The smartphone menu is always accessible on both tablet and smartphone devices when tapping on the sub header.
%
%\framework{\lungoa}{}
%The framework has the function \code{Lungo.Core.isMobile()} to know if the current device is a mobile device or not.
%\quo{} has extra attributes for \code{browser}, \code{os.name}, \code{os.name}, \code{env.os.version} and \code{screen}.
%The latter only gives the width and height, so the developer still needs to program it manually.
%As a solution, the same method as for \jqma{} was used, namely CSS3 media queries.
%The smartphone menu is always accessible on both tablet and smartphone devices when tapping on the sub header.

%Within \st{} a \code{Store} can be configured with a proxy to read and write data in the \code{sessionStorage} or \code{localStorage} of the browser.
%However,  \code{Stores} can not be configured with two proxies so if data is provided by an external source and needs to be stored locally,  two \code{Stores} need to be created and kept synchronized.
